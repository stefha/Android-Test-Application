# Stef is on Github

I can't believe my *awesomest*(Hehe typo made by Stefan :) ) brother made it to the online VCS world!

He can not just change the world, but this file too !!!!!

And we can even do awesome code highlighting:

```java
class Awesome extends LessAwesome {
    public static void main() {
        // do stuff ...
    }
}

```
